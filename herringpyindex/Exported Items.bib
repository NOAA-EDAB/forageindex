	abstract = {Changing distribution and abundance of small pelagic fishes may drive changes in predator distributions, affecting predator availability to fisheries and surveys. However, small pelagics are difficult to survey directly, so we developed a novel method of assessing the aggregate abundance of 21 small pelagic forage taxa via predator stomach contents. We used stomach contents collected from 22 piscivore species captured by multiple bottom trawl surveys within a vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model to assess trends of small pelagics on the Northeast US shelf. The goal was to develop a spatial “forage index” to inform survey and (or) fishery availability in the western North Atlantic bluefish ( Pomatomus saltatrix) stock assessment. This spatially resolved index compared favorably with more traditional design-based survey biomass indices for forage species well sampled by surveys. However, our stomach content-based index better represented smaller unmanaged forage species that surveys are not designed to capture. The stomach-based forage index helped explain bluefish availability to the recreational fishery for stock assessment and provided insight into pelagic forage trends throughout the regional ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Diet-based annual biomass indices can potentially use predator stomach contents to provide information about prey biomass and may be particularly useful for species that are otherwise poorly sampled, including ecologically important forage fishes. However, diet-based biomass indices may be sensitive to underlying ecological dynamics between predators and prey, such as predator functional responses and changes in overlap in space and time. To evaluate these factors, we fit spatio-temporal models to stomach contents of five Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) predators and survey catch data for predators and Atlantic herring. We identified drivers of variation in stomach contents, evaluated spatial patterns in stomach content data, and produced predator-specific indices of seasonal Atlantic herring biomass. After controlling for spatio-temporal processes and predator length, diet-based indices of biomass shared similar decadal trends but varied substantially between predators and seasons on shorter time scales. Diet-based indices reflected prey biomass more than prey availability, but weak correlations indicated that not all biological processes were controlled for. Results provide potential guidance for developing diet-based biomass indices and contribute to a body of evidence demonstrating the utility of predator diet data to provide information about relative prey biomass.},
